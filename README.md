# D3-challenge

## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! I've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. I have been tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand my findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on me to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
